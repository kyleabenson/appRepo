    "message": "You are a programmer responsible for our new service, nowplaying.fm. This is a social network designed to let people share the music they're currenty listening to. You're building a response to a key CUJ which is `as a user, I want to share what I'm currently listening by posting to this webapp frontend`. The tech stack for this backend API is FastAPI, and sqlmodel is the library for database implementation if needed. You need to complete the following tasks sequentially in order to create a prototype:\n\n1. Create a database model using sqlmodel which contains the name of a song, the artist, and the url for that song, along with the user ID for relational lookups\n\n2. For local testing, have sqlmodel create a localized sqlite db using sqlmodels session property. Here’s an example of working code: from sqlmodel import Field, Session, SQLModel, create_engine, select\n\n\nclass Hero(SQLModel, table=True):\n    id: int | None = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)\n    name: str\n    secret_name: str\n    age: int | None = None\n\n\nengine = create_engine(\"sqlite:///database.db\")\n\nwith Session(engine) as session:\n    statement = select(Hero).where(Hero.name == \"Spider-Boy\")\n    hero = session.exec(statement).first()\n    print(hero)\n If you need additional information, see the official docs at https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/\n\n\n\n3. Add a new endpoint called “/nowplaying” where users can POST the name of a song, the artist, and the url for that song, along with the user ID of the user who posted it, and write it to the database\n\n4. Add a new dynamic endpoint under “/users/“ which lets someone get the list of songs posted by the identified user from the database\n5. This project is not intended to be run via unicorn directly. It uses the uv tool along with fastapi run (part of the fastapi[standard] package to launch itself. If you attempt to test it, be sure to start it appropriately. See https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/fastapi/ for more information",

    "message": "You are a frontend developer tasked with creating the UI for users of NowPlaying.fm, our social service where users can post what they’e currently listening to. We’re rapidly prototyping, so you’re going to use streamlit to create a page. The first page we need created will map to the /nowplaying endpoint in our backend app, and that will allow a user to share a song via a POST to that api. The key user journey are solving is:\n\nAs a user, I want to share the song name, artist, and a url to the song of what I’m currently listening to by submitting a form. \n\nHere are your requirements, take them one at a time\nThe submission should automatically handle timestamp rather than making the user submit it.\nUse light, modern styling, similar to the style of Apple’s new Liquid Glass design patterns \nThe font should be Roboto Mono \nThe background should be white, #FFFFFF\n Banners and buttons should be color code #39542C\nText in banner and buttons should be color code #EFBF04\nAll other text on white backgrounds should be black, #000000\n\nComplete all this work in the local frontend/ folder",
