You're building a response to a key CUJ which is `as a user, I want to share what I'm currently listening by posting to this webapp frontend`. The tech stack for this backend API is FastAPI, and sqlmodel is the library for database implementation if needed. You need to complete the following tasks sequentially in order to create a prototype:\n\n1. Create a database model using sqlmodel which contains the name of a song, the artist, and the url for that song, along with the user ID for relational lookups\n\n2. For local testing, have sqlmodel create a localized sqlite db using sqlmodels session property. Here’s an example of working code: from sqlmodel import Field, Session, SQLModel, create_engine, select\n\n\nclass Hero(SQLModel, table=True):\n    id: int | None = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)\n    name: str\n    secret_name: str\n    age: int | None = None\n\n\nengine = create_engine(\"sqlite:///database.db\")\n\nwith Session(engine) as session:\n    statement = select(Hero).where(Hero.name == \"Spider-Boy\")\n    hero = session.exec(statement).first()\n    print(hero)\n If you need additional information, see the official docs at https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/\n\n\n\n3. Add a new endpoint called “/nowplaying” where users can POST the name of a song, the artist, and the url for that song, along with the user ID of the user who posted it, and write it to the database\n\n4. Add a new dynamic endpoint under “/users/“ which lets someone get the list of songs posted by the identified user from the database\n5. This project is not intended to be run via unicorn directly. It uses the uv tool along with fastapi run (part of the fastapi[standard] package to launch itself. If you attempt to test it, be sure to start it appropriately. See https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/fastapi/ for more information",
